# What is financial independence?

Financial Independent (FI) is when your income from investment equals your spending. It gives you the opportunity to pursue the interests and goals that really matter without having to worry about finances.

For a primer, check out [Mr. Money Mustache's blog](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/)

# Why this app?

Figuring out when you will achieve financial independence is difficult. It depends on tons of variables: your income, you savings rate, your taxes and use of tax-deferred accounts and importantly forecasts for your investment portfolio. This app attempts to take some of this guess work out of estimating when you will hit FI.

# What does it do?

This app calculates your taxes, your contributions to accounts and then forecasts the growth of your investment portfolio. The user supplies their expected income for the next several years, and then can set their saving rate and the aggressiveness of their investment portfolio.
